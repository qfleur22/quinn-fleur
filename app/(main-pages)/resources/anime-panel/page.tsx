        <RoomSection title="Built for Anime Convention Panelists">
          <p>This kit is specifically for people who want to present at:</p>
          <p>
            Anime conventions • Comic conventions • Fan conventions • University anime clubs •
            LGBTQ+ conferences • Libraries • Community events • Queer organizations • Educational
            programs
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether this is your first panel or your fiftieth, the hardest part is often not
            standing in front of the room.
          </p>
          <p>It&apos;s building something worth presenting.</p>
          <p>
            This kit gives you the framework, research, examples, and talking points so you can
            spend your time learning and personalizing the material instead of rebuilding the
            entire subject from scratch.
          </p>
        </RoomSection>

        <RoomSection title="The Panel Topic">
          <h3 className="font-display text-xl text-room-teal">Trans+ Representation in Anime</h3>
          <p>Anime has a long, fascinating, and often extremely complicated relationship with gender.</p>
          <p>The presentation explores:</p>
          <BulletList items={topicItems} />
          <p>
            It&apos;s designed to give audiences both recommendations and something interesting to
            think about afterward.
          </p>
        </RoomSection>

        <RoomSection title="Not Just “Here Are Some Trans Anime Characters”">
          <p>A good convention panel needs an argument.</p>
          <p>Otherwise you&apos;re just reading a list off a screen.</p>
          <p>
            This presentation is structured around a framework for evaluating representation
            through four major questions:
          </p>
          <h3 className="font-display text-xl text-room-teal">Community</h3>
          <p>Does the character have supportive relationships, queer community, or chosen family?</p>
          <h3 className="font-display text-xl text-room-teal">Agency</h3>
          <p>
            Does the character get to define their own identity and make decisions about their own
            life?
          </p>
          <h3 className="font-display text-xl text-room-teal">Respect</h3>
          <p>
            Does the narrative itself treat the character with dignity, even when other characters
            do not?
          </p>
          <h3 className="font-display text-xl text-room-teal">Depth</h3>
          <p>
            Is this a complete character with goals, flaws, relationships, and personality beyond
            gender?
          </p>
          <p>
            That framework lets you do much more than tell your audience whether I personally
            &ldquo;like&rdquo; a character.
          </p>
          <p>It gives the room a way to participate in the analysis.</p>

        <RoomSection title="What’s Included" id="whats-included">
          <h3 id="presentation" className="scroll-mt-40 font-display text-xl text-room-teal">
            1. The Complete PowerPoint Presentation
          </h3>
          <p>
            The core of the kit is a ready-to-use slide deck built specifically for presenting this
            topic to an audience.
          </p>
          <p>The presentation moves through:</p>
          <p>
            Introduction → Representation framework → Historical context → Explicit trans
            representation → Gender-diverse characters → Gender exploration → Strong representation
            → Complicated examples → Problematic representation → Recommendations → Discussion
          </p>
          <p>The deck gives you a clear visual structure so you don&apos;t have to invent one.</p>
          <p>Use the presentation as-is or edit it to fit:</p>

            2. Detailed Presenter Notes
          </h3>
          <p>Slides tell you what the audience sees.</p>
          <p>They don&apos;t tell you what the hell you&apos;re supposed to say.</p>
          <p>The kit includes presenter notes that give you the context behind the presentation.</p>
          <p>The notes can help with:</p>
          <BulletList items={notesItems} />
          <p>You don&apos;t have to memorize my exact wording.</p>
          <p>
            The notes are there to give you enough understanding of the material that you can
            explain it naturally.
          </p>
          <p>
            They&apos;re especially useful if you&apos;re presenting an anime you haven&apos;t
            personally watched recently or need a reminder about why a particular example matters.

            3. The Trans+ Anime Representation Spreadsheet
          </h3>
          <p>And then there&apos;s the spreadsheet.</p>
          <p>
            The research database behind the panel contains a much larger collection of anime and
            manga than can fit into a single convention presentation.
          </p>
          <p>Entries can include:</p>
          <p>
            Series • Character • Year • Representation type • Community • Agency • Respect • Depth
            • Overall representation rating • Genres • Tropes • Trigger warnings • Historical
            context • Character notes • Strengths • Weaknesses • Discussion notes • Presentation
            recommendations
          </p>
          <p>This makes the spreadsheet useful for much more than simply preparing the included panel.</p>
          <p>You can use it to:</p>
          <BulletList items={spreadsheetUses} />
          <p>In other words:</p>
          <p>The PowerPoint gives you the panel.</p>
          <p>The spreadsheet gives you the research library behind it.</p>

        <RoomSection title="Why Buy a Panel Kit Instead of Making One Yourself?">
          <p>You absolutely can make your own.</p>
          <p>
            But making a good convention panel takes more work than it looks like from the
            audience.
          </p>
          <p>For a research-heavy topic like this, you may spend hours:</p>
          <p>Watching or rewatching anime.</p>
          <p>Reading manga.</p>
          <p>Checking character information.</p>
          <p>Researching publication history.</p>
          <p>Comparing translations.</p>
          <p>Looking into historical context.</p>
          <p>Trying to distinguish fan interpretation from canon.</p>
          <p>Finding examples.</p>
          <p>Organizing them.</p>
          <p>Writing explanations.</p>
          <p>Building slides.</p>
          <p>Cutting slides.</p>
          <p>Putting the slides back.</p>
          <p>Cutting them again.</p>
          <p>
            Realizing your &ldquo;60-minute panel&rdquo; currently takes two hours and seventeen
            minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            This kit gives you the benefit of my existing research so you don&apos;t have to begin
            at the beginning.
          </p>
        </RoomSection>

        <RoomSection title="Made to Be Customized">
          <p>You do not have to give my exact panel.</p>
          <p>In fact, you probably shouldn&apos;t.</p>
          <p>The kit is designed to be a foundation.</p>
          <p>Maybe you want more manga.</p>
          <p>Maybe you&apos;re obsessed with 1990s anime.</p>
          <p>Maybe you want an entire section on magical transformation.</p>
          <p>Maybe you only have 45 minutes.</p>
          <p>Maybe the convention gave you 90.</p>
          <p>Maybe your audience is mostly queer people.</p>
          <p>
            Maybe your audience is a general anime crowd that has never thought critically about
            gender representation before.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe there&apos;s one series you know so well that you want to replace three of my
            examples with it.
          </p>
          <p>Do it.</p>
          <p>
            The best version of the presentation is the version you actually feel comfortable
            presenting.

        <RoomSection title="Great for First-Time Panelists">
          <p>
            If you&apos;ve never submitted a convention panel before, starting with a complete
            presentation can make the process dramatically less intimidating.
          </p>
          <p>Instead of asking:</p>
          <p className="italic">&ldquo;Can I build an hour of content?&rdquo;</p>
          <p>you can focus on:</p>
          <p className="italic">&ldquo;How do I make this content mine?&rdquo;</p>
          <p>You&apos;ve already got:</p>
          <p>A topic.</p>
          <p>A structure.</p>
          <p>A slide deck.</p>
          <p>Research.</p>
          <p>Examples.</p>
          <p>Talking points.</p>
          <p>Backup material.</p>
          <p>That gives you more room to practice the part that really matters:</p>
          <p>Presenting.</p>
        </RoomSection>

        <RoomSection title="Great for Experienced Panelists Too">
          <p>
            Experienced presenters know exactly how much time research and slide creation can
            consume.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you already know how to work a room, this kit gives you a shortcut to a thoroughly
            researched topic.
          </p>
          <p>Use it to:</p>

          <p>You don&apos;t have to reinvent every panel you present.</p>
        </RoomSection>

        <RoomSection title="Turn One Kit Into Multiple Panels">
          <p>The research behind this kit can support much more than one presentation.</p>
          <p>For example, you could eventually build panels like:</p>
          <p>
            <strong>The History of Gender in Anime</strong>
            <br />
            From early manga through contemporary trans representation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Good, Bad &amp; Complicated Trans Representation in Anime</strong>
            <br />
            A deeper media-analysis panel.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Gender Transformation in Anime</strong>
            <br />
            Body swaps, magical transformations, reincarnation, and what they say about identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Trans Manga You Should Be Reading</strong>
            <br />
            A recommendation-focused panel.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Queer Anime Beyond Yuri and Yaoi</strong>
            <br />
            Looking at broader LGBTQ+ representation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How Anime Talks About Gender</strong>
            <br />
            A more introductory presentation for general audiences.
          </p>
          <p>The included panel gets you started.</p>
          <p>The database gives you room to keep going.</p>
        </RoomSection>

        <RoomSection title="Worried About Audience Questions?">
          <p>Welcome to anime conventions.</p>
          <p>At some point, someone may ask:</p>
          <p className="italic">
            &ldquo;Okay, but what about [series you have never heard of]?&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>The spreadsheet gives you a much larger reference pool than the presentation itself.</p>
          <p>It can also help you prepare for conversations around:</p>
          <p>
            Whether a character is canonically trans • Translation differences • Historical
            terminology • Gender-nonconforming vs. trans interpretation • Problematic tropes •
            Cultural context • Why different viewers interpret a character differently
          </p>
          <p>You still don&apos;t need to know everything.</p>
          <p>A perfectly acceptable answer at a panel is:</p>
          <p className="italic">
            &ldquo;I haven&apos;t researched that one enough to give you a good answer.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>But having a giant spreadsheet helps.</p>

        <RoomSection title="Practice the Whole Panel Before the Con">
          <p>One of the best uses of coaching is simple:</p>
          <p>Give the presentation.</p>
          <p>Run the slides.</p>
          <p>Talk through the material.</p>
          <p>Pretend there&apos;s an audience.</p>
          <p>I can help identify:</p>
          <p>Where you&apos;re rushing</p>
          <p>Where the explanation is unclear</p>
          <p>Which section is eating too much time</p>
          <p>Where the room may need more context</p>
          <p>Which examples you&apos;re strongest on</p>
          <p>Where an audience question is likely to derail things</p>
          <p>Whether your 60-minute panel is secretly a 96-minute panel</p>
          <p>Then you can go into the convention having already done it once.</p>
          <p>
            That&apos;s a very different feeling from standing at the podium and realizing slide 42
            exists for the first time.

        <RoomSection title="Created by Quinn Fleur">
          <p>Hi, I&apos;m Quinn Fleur.</p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m trans, neurodivergent, an anime fan, a media-analysis nerd, and someone who
            has spent a deeply unreasonable amount of time putting transgender and gender-diverse
            anime into spreadsheets.
          </p>
          <p>I built this presentation because I wanted to talk about trans representation in a way that went beyond:</p>
          <p className="italic">&ldquo;Here are some queer characters I like.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>I wanted to talk about why certain portrayals work.</p>
          <p>Why some don&apos;t.</p>
          <p>Why historical context matters.</p>
          <p>Why a character doesn&apos;t need to be perfect representation to be important.</p>
          <p>Why not every gender-bending anime is a trans story.</p>
          <p>
            And why anime&apos;s relationship with gender is so much richer and stranger than
            people often realize.
          </p>
          <p>Then I did the research.</p>
          <p>Then I made the panel.</p>
          <p>Then I made the spreadsheet much, much larger than the panel.</p>
          <p>Now you can use all of it without having to recreate the whole project yourself.</p>

        <RoomSection title="Stop Building Every Panel From Scratch">
          <p>You still get to make the presentation yours.</p>
          <p>You still get to choose your examples.</p>
          <p>You still get to bring your own interpretation.</p>
          <p>You still get to argue with the audience about anime.</p>
          <p>You just don&apos;t have to begin with a blank slide.</p>
          <p>Get the presentation.</p>
          <p>Get the notes.</p>
