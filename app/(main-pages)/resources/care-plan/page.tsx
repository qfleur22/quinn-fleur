        <p>When you&apos;re doing well, you might know exactly what helps you.</p>
        <p>Then you&apos;re overwhelmed.</p>
        <p>Your brain stops cooperating.</p>
        <p>Someone asks:</p>
        <p className="italic">&ldquo;What do you need?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>And suddenly that is the most impossible question anyone has ever asked you.</p>
        <p>Do you need food?</p>
        <p>Quiet?</p>
        <p>Medication?</p>
        <p>Company?</p>
        <p>To go home?</p>
        <p>A hug?</p>
        <p>Absolutely no one to touch you?</p>
        <p>Are you anxious?</p>
        <p>In pain?</p>
        <p>Sensory overloaded?</p>
        <p>Burned out?</p>
        <p>Just really fucking tired?</p>
        <p>You don&apos;t know.</p>
        <p>Your loved one doesn&apos;t know.</p>
        <p>Everyone wants to help.</p>
        <p>
          And now you have to somehow explain your nervous system while actively losing access to
          the part of your brain that explains things.
        </p>
        <p>So figure it out before you need it.</p>
        <p>
          My Guide to Making a Care Plan helps you create a personalized manual for understanding,
          supporting, communicating with, and caring for yourself—especially when doing those
          things becomes difficult.

        <GuideCta href={buyHref} label={DIY_LABEL} isDominant />

        <RoomSection title="What Is a Care Plan?">
          <p>Think of it as:</p>
          <p>An instruction manual for being you.</p>
          <p>Not because you&apos;re a machine.</p>
          <p>And definitely not because somebody else should get to control you.</p>
          <p>A good care plan communicates things like:</p>
          <p>This is what I&apos;m like when I&apos;m okay.</p>
          <p>This is how you&apos;ll know I&apos;m starting to struggle.</p>
          <p>This is what overwhelm looks like for me.</p>
          <p>This behavior probably doesn&apos;t mean what you think it means.</p>
          <p>This is how I communicate when words get hard.</p>
          <p>These things usually help.</p>
          <p>Please, for the love of God, do not do these things.</p>
          <p>Here&apos;s what to check when I don&apos;t know what I need.</p>
          <p>Here&apos;s what a crisis looks like.</p>
          <p>Here&apos;s who to call.</p>
          <p>Here&apos;s what my medical conditions look like when they flare.</p>
          <p>Here&apos;s how I want conflict handled.</p>
          <p>And if I can&apos;t effectively advocate for myself, here&apos;s what I want you to know.</p>
          <p>
            Your care plan externalizes information that otherwise has to live entirely in your
            head.
          </p>
        </RoomSection>

        <RoomSection title="This Isn’t Just a Crisis Plan">
          <p>Crisis plans matter.</p>
          <p>But this Care Plan starts much earlier.</p>
          <p>
            Because the best time to figure out what helps during a meltdown isn&apos;t necessarily
            during the meltdown.
          </p>
          <p>The system looks at the entire spectrum:</p>
          <p>Doing Well → Stressed → Overwhelmed → Crisis</p>
          <p>What changes?</p>
          <p>What disappears first?</p>
          <p>What becomes harder?</p>
          <p>What can someone else notice?</p>
          <p>What helps at each stage?</p>
          <p>And most importantly:</p>
          <p>Can we intervene while the problem is still small?</p>
          <p>
            Sometimes the difference between an awful night and a manageable one isn&apos;t a
            revolutionary coping skill.
          </p>
          <p>
            It&apos;s noticing at 4 p.m. that you&apos;re hungry, dehydrated, overstimulated, in
            pain, haven&apos;t taken your medication, and have agreed to three more things than
            your brain can currently process.

        <RoomSection title="The Blank Care Plan">
          <p>You don&apos;t have to invent the structure yourself.</p>
          <p>
            The Blank Personal Care Plan Template walks you through creating your own plan using
            detailed prompts, checklists, examples, and spaces for customization.
          </p>
          <p>Build it for yourself.</p>
          <p>Build one collaboratively with a partner.</p>
          <p>Help a friend make theirs.</p>
          <p>Use it with a client, where appropriate to your role and scope.</p>
          <p>Make a short version.</p>
          <p>Make an enormous one.</p>
          <p>Ignore sections that don&apos;t apply.</p>
          <p>Go absolutely feral with the highlighter.</p>
          <p>The point is to make a document that actually reflects the person using it.</p>

        <RoomSection title="Start With a Quick Reference">
          <p>
            Your first pages shouldn&apos;t require someone to read your autobiography before they
            can help you.
          </p>
          <p>The Care Plan begins with a quick-reference section covering information such as:</p>
          <p>
            Preferred name • Pronouns • Emergency contacts • Important medical information •
            Communication needs • What I&apos;m like when I&apos;m doing well • What struggling
            looks like • Common misunderstandings • What helps • What to avoid • Who to contact •
            When to get additional help • Emergency instructions
          </p>
          <p>Then the rest of the plan explains those things in detail.</p>
          <p>
            It&apos;s designed so someone can get the basics in a few minutes and go deeper when
            they need to.
          </p>
        </RoomSection>

        <RoomSection title="“People Think I’m Angry When I’m Actually Overwhelmed.”">
          <p>This is exactly the kind of information a care plan can capture.</p>
          <p>Maybe:</p>
          <p>Your silence gets interpreted as punishment.</p>
          <p>Your tone gets interpreted as anger.</p>
          <p>Your pacing gets interpreted as agitation.</p>
          <p>Your lack of eye contact gets interpreted as disrespect.</p>
          <p>Your withdrawal gets interpreted as rejection.</p>
          <p>Your increased joking gets interpreted as being fine.</p>
          <p>
            Your irritability gets interpreted as hostility when you&apos;re actually in severe
            pain.
          </p>
          <p>Your inability to answer gets interpreted as refusing to communicate.</p>
          <p>Your plan can explain:</p>
          <p>What people see.</p>
          <p>and</p>
          <p>What it actually means.</p>
          <p>Sometimes that distinction can prevent an enormous amount of unnecessary conflict.</p>

          <p>Try:</p>
          <p className="italic">&ldquo;Soup, sandwich, or should I choose?&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Sometimes support isn&apos;t doing more.</p>
          <p>It&apos;s making the cognitive load smaller.</p>
        </RoomSection>

        <RoomSection title="The Communication Guide">
          <p>Because &ldquo;just communicate&rdquo; is terrible advice if nobody explains how.</p>
          <p>A major section of the Care Plan is devoted entirely to communication.</p>
          <p>You&apos;ll work out:</p>
          <p>How people should check in with you</p>
          <p>How frequently you like check-ins</p>
          <p>Whether you prefer direct or gentle communication</p>
          <p>How much processing time you need</p>
          <p>What happens to your communication under stress</p>
          <p>What alternative communication methods work</p>
          <p>How people can tell you need space</p>
          <p>Which questions are easiest to answer</p>
          <p>Which questions make your brain completely freeze</p>
          <p>Whether touch helps</p>
          <p>Whether eye contact helps</p>
          <p>Whether conversation helps</p>
          <p>Whether silence helps</p>
          <p>How difficult conversations should be approached</p>
          <p>What reassurance actually works</p>
          <p>How someone should reconnect after giving you space</p>
          <p>And even:</p>
          <p>How will someone know their support is working?</p>
          <p>Maybe you start joking again.</p>
          <p>Maybe you can answer more complicated questions.</p>
          <p>Maybe your body relaxes.</p>
          <p>Maybe you start making decisions.</p>
          <p>Maybe you ask for food.</p>
          <p>Those tiny signs matter.</p>
        </RoomSection>

        <RoomSection title="Build Backup Communication for When Words Stop Working">
          <p>Maybe verbal communication becomes difficult when you&apos;re overwhelmed.</p>
          <p>Your plan can identify alternatives such as:</p>
          <p>Texting</p>
          <p>Writing</p>
          <p>Notes apps</p>
          <p>Communication cards</p>
          <p>AAC</p>
          <p>Emoji responses</p>
          <p>Number scales</p>
          <p>Green / Yellow / Orange / Red</p>
          <p>Thumbs up/down</p>
          <p>Pointing</p>
          <p>Hand signals</p>
          <p>
            You don&apos;t need to suddenly become excellent at spoken emotional communication
            while having the worst day of your month.
          </p>
          <p>Build another route.</p>
        </RoomSection>

        <RoomSection title="The Green / Yellow / Orange / Red System">
          <p>One of the core tools in the Care Plan is a personalized distress scale.</p>
          <h3 className="font-display text-xl text-room-teal">🟢 Green — My Normal Range</h3>
          <p>Green doesn&apos;t mean perfectly healthy or symptom-free.</p>
          <p>It means:</p>
          <p>I&apos;m generally managing.</p>
          <p>What does that look like for you?</p>
          <p>How much are you socializing?</p>
          <p>What routines are intact?</p>
          <p>What does your normal energy look like?</p>
          <h3 className="font-display text-xl text-room-teal">🟡 Yellow — Something Is Starting to Slip</h3>
          <p>This is often where intervention is easiest.</p>
          <p>Maybe you&apos;re:</p>
          <p>More irritable.</p>
          <p>Sleeping worse.</p>
          <p>Cancelling plans.</p>
          <p>Forgetting things.</p>
          <p>Masking harder.</p>
          <p>Procrastinating more.</p>
          <p>Having increased pain.</p>
          <p>Becoming more sensitive to sensory input.</p>
          <p>What can you change now before Yellow becomes Orange?</p>
          <h3 className="font-display text-xl text-room-teal">🟠 Orange — I’m Overwhelmed</h3>
          <p>Your resources are running out.</p>
          <p>Communication gets harder.</p>
          <p>Executive function disappears.</p>
          <p>Everything takes more effort.</p>
          <p>Maybe you need:</p>
          <p>
            Yes/no questions • Reduced stimulation • Fewer demands • Food • Medication • Help
            prioritizing • Comfort items • Rest • Difficult conversations postponed
          </p>
          <h3 className="font-display text-xl text-room-teal">🔴 Red — Crisis</h3>
          <p>Your normal coping strategies aren&apos;t enough.</p>
          <p>This section connects directly to your personalized Safety / Red Alert Plan.</p>
          <p>
            Instead of asking supporters to invent a crisis response while everyone is scared:

          <p>Open the Distress Checklist.</p>
          <p>Sometimes you genuinely don&apos;t know.</p>
          <p>So the Care Plan includes a systematic check of:</p>
          <h3 className="font-display text-xl text-room-teal">Food &amp; Hydration</h3>
          <p>Have I eaten?</p>
          <p>Had water?</p>

          <p>A Comfort Menu isn’t simply:</p>
          <p>Things That Make Me Happy™</p>
          <p>
            It’s a collection of interventions, accommodations, activities, and supports that can

          </p>
          <p>Your menu can include categories like:</p>

            <strong>Comfort</strong>

            Headphones, temperature changes, fidgets, movement, compression, music.

            <strong>Rest</strong>
            <br />
            Reduced input, sleep routines, eyes-closed audio, permission to stop.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cognitive Rest</strong>
            <br />
            Brain dumps, decision help, one-task rules, putting worries somewhere for later.

          <p>
            <strong>Emotional Support</strong>

            <strong>Spiritual Care</strong>

            Nature, ritual, prayer, gratitude, spiritual practice.

            <strong>Practical Support</strong>
            <br />
            Calendar checks, prioritization, preparing for tomorrow, offloading responsibilities.

          <p>Some people need another layer.</p>
          <p>
            The template includes an optional Medical Support section for chronically ill,
            disabled, and medically complicated people.
          </p>
          <p>This section isn’t a replacement for medical care.</p>
          <p>It’s a personalized reference for the people who support you.</p>
          <p>You can document:</p>
          <p>
            Important diagnoses • Medications • Rescue medications • Allergies • Mobility aids •
            Baseline symptoms • Common flares • What usually helps • What makes symptoms worse •
            When your normal plan isn’t enough • When outside medical help is appropriate
          </p>
          <p>The template includes customizable starting points for areas such as:</p>
          <p>Joint instability and hypermobility</p>
          <p>POTS / dysautonomia-type flares</p>
          <p>Allergic or mast-cell-type symptoms</p>
          <p>GI flares</p>

          <p>Sleep problems</p>
          <p>
            Then you personalize them based on your own healthcare plan and clinician guidance.

        <RoomSection title="Create a High / Medium / Low Capacity Plan">
          <p>Not every day has the same number of spoons.</p>
          <p>
            Instead of expecting yourself to maintain your highest level of functioning every day,
            you can create different plans.
          </p>
          <h3 className="font-display text-xl text-room-teal">High Capacity</h3>
          <p>What can I reasonably do?</p>

          <p>What support becomes useful?</p>
          <h3 className="font-display text-xl text-room-teal">Low Capacity</h3>
          <p>What is actually essential?</p>
          <p>What can be paused?</p>
          <p>What should someone else take over?</p>
          <p>A low-capacity plan means you don’t have to decide whether you’re “failing.”</p>
          <p>You’re following the plan for the capacity you actually have.</p>
        </RoomSection>

        <RoomSection title="Relationships Need Care Plans Too">
          <p>Your Care Plan can also explain how you want conflict handled.</p>
          <p>Not:</p>
          <p className="italic">&ldquo;Nobody is ever allowed to disagree with me.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>But:</p>
          <p className="italic">
            &ldquo;Here’s how we have a disagreement without making everything ten times worse.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>You’ll explore:</p>
          <p>How concerns should be brought up</p>
          <p>When difficult conversations should happen</p>
          <p>When they absolutely should not</p>
          <p>What communication helps</p>
          <p>What makes conflict escalate</p>
          <p>How to know when you need a break</p>
          <p>How to pause without abandoning the issue</p>
          <p>What accountability means to you</p>
          <p>What makes an apology meaningful</p>
          <p>How you rebuild trust</p>
          <p>How you reconnect after conflict</p>
          <p>Sometimes:</p>
          <p className="italic">&ldquo;Can we talk about something difficult?&rdquo;</p>
          <p>
            works much better than launching into the issue while someone is half-asleep, hungry,
            overstimulated, and trying to put on their shoes.
          </p>
        </RoomSection>

        <RoomSection title="Know When to Pause">
          <p>Your plan helps identify signs that productive communication has stopped.</p>
          <p>Maybe you’re:</p>
          <p>Dissociating</p>
          <p>Crying uncontrollably</p>
          <p>Unable to speak</p>
          <p>Repeating yourself</p>
          <p>Unable to process information</p>
          <p>Entering a meltdown or panic attack</p>
          <p>Maybe the other person is escalating.</p>
          <p>Maybe both of you are simply talking in circles.</p>
          <p>The plan can establish ahead of time:</p>
          <p>How do we pause?</p>
          <p>How long?</p>
          <p>Who reconnects?</p>
          <p>When are we coming back?</p>
          <p>What does “I need a break” actually mean?</p>
          <p>Because taking a break from conflict and abandoning conflict aren’t the same thing.</p>

            know?

          <p>
            A care-plan workshop shouldn’t involve the facilitator diagnosing participants or
            deciding what they need.
          </p>
          <p>Your role is to ask better questions.</p>
          <p>Instead of:</p>
          <p className="italic">&ldquo;You should put weighted blankets on your plan.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>try:</p>
          <p className="italic">
            &ldquo;When you’re overwhelmed, does pressure feel regulating, uncomfortable, or does
            it depend?&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>Instead of:</p>
          <p className="italic">&ldquo;Your emergency contact should be your parent.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>ask:</p>
          <p className="italic">
            &ldquo;Who actually stays calm and respects your choices when something goes wrong?&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>Instead of:</p>
          <p className="italic">&ldquo;Everyone needs someone with them during a crisis.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>ask:</p>
          <p className="italic">
            &ldquo;Does another person’s presence help you regulate, or can it increase your
            distress?&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>The workshop framework is built around:</p>
          <p>Curiosity rather than assumptions.</p>

            If you want to host a Care Plan Creation Workshop but aren’t sure how to actually run
            one, I can help you prepare.

        <RoomSection title="Adapt the Workshop to Your Community">
          <p>Not every group needs the same Care Plan.</p>
          <p>A workshop for autistic adults may spend much more time on:</p>
          <p>Communication • Sensory needs • Shutdowns • Meltdowns • Masking • Executive function</p>
          <p>A chronic-illness group may emphasize:</p>
          <p>Capacity • Flares • Medical support • Mobility • Pain • Post-exertion recovery</p>
          <p>A queer community organization might focus on:</p>
          <p>Chosen family • Identity • Autonomy • Emergency contacts • Community support</p>
          <p>A caregiver workshop may emphasize:</p>
          <p>Supporting without controlling • Recognizing warning signs • Communication • Consent around care</p>
          <p>A mental-health peer-support group may spend more time on:</p>
          <p>Distress levels • Crisis planning • Coping strategies • Safe people • Reconnection</p>
          <p>
            I can help you adapt the framework without requiring every participant to squeeze
            themselves into the same template.

        <RoomSection title="Want to Help Someone One-on-One?">
          <p>
            The facilitator resources can also support structured individual care-plan creation,
            not only workshops.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your role appropriately includes this kind of support, the framework can help you
            guide someone through:
          </p>
          <p>Understanding their baseline</p>
          <p>Identifying early warning signs</p>
          <p>Recognizing unmet needs</p>
          <p>Creating communication accommodations</p>
          <p>Building a Comfort Menu</p>
          <p>Planning for different capacities</p>
          <p>Documenting support preferences</p>
          <p>Creating a crisis plan</p>
          <p>Preparing healthcare accommodations</p>
          <p>The principle stays the same:</p>
          <p>You’re not writing a plan about someone.</p>
          <p>You’re helping them create a plan that belongs to them.</p>

        <RoomSection title="Created by Quinn Fleur">
          <p>Hi, I&apos;m Quinn Fleur.</p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m autistic, ADHD, disabled, chronically ill, queer, and someone whose ability
            to explain what I need can change dramatically depending on how I&apos;m doing.
          </p>
          <p>I can be incredibly articulate about my needs.</p>
          <p>I can also become overwhelmed enough that:</p>
          <p className="italic">&ldquo;What do you need?&rdquo;</p>
          <p>might as well be:</p>
          <p className="italic">
            &ldquo;Please derive the quadratic formula while the building is on fire.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>I started developing this kind of care planning because I wanted to externalize some of that work.</p>
          <p>I wanted the people who care about me to know:</p>
          <p>What I’m like normally.</p>
          <p>What changes first.</p>
          <p>What helps.</p>
          <p>What doesn’t.</p>
          <p>How to communicate with me.</p>
          <p>When to leave me alone.</p>
          <p>When not to leave me alone.</p>
          <p>What my disabilities actually look like.</p>
          <p>What to check when neither of us knows what’s wrong.</p>
          <p>And what I want to happen if everything really does go sideways.</p>
          <p>But the more I worked on it, the more I realized:</p>
          <p>
            You shouldn’t have to be in crisis to benefit from knowing how you want to be cared
            for.
          </p>
          <p>A care plan can help us understand ourselves on ordinary days too.</p>
        </RoomSection>

        <RoomSection title="A Care Plan Isn’t Permission to Control Someone">
          <p>This is important.</p>
          <p>A Care Plan should support autonomy.</p>
          <p>It should not become:</p>
          <p className="italic">
            &ldquo;Your document says you’re Orange, therefore I’m taking over.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Support still requires communication and consent whenever the person is capable of
            participating.
          </p>
          <p>Someone’s plan may explicitly say:</p>
          <p>Let me take reasonable risks.</p>
          <p>Don’t make decisions for me.</p>
          <p>Ask before touching me.</p>
          <p>Offer help instead of automatically taking over.</p>
          <p>Give me processing time.</p>
          <p>Believe me when I tell you something isn’t helping.</p>
          <p>
            The purpose of knowing someone’s needs is to support their autonomy—not replace it.
          </p>
        </RoomSection>

        <RoomSection title="Your Care Plan Is Allowed to Change">
          <p>The plan you make today isn’t a contract with Future You.</p>
          <p>Maybe you discover a better communication strategy.</p>
          <p>Maybe medication changes your baseline.</p>
          <p>Maybe you get diagnosed.</p>
          <p>Maybe you recover from burnout.</p>
          <p>Maybe your disability progresses.</p>
          <p>Maybe you realize a coping strategy you’ve used for years doesn’t actually help.</p>
          <p>Maybe a relationship changes.</p>
          <p>Maybe you simply understand yourself better.</p>
          <p>Update it.</p>
          <p>Cross things out.</p>
          <p>Add pages.</p>
          <p>Delete entire sections.</p>
          <p>Write:</p>
          <p className="italic">&ldquo;We tried this. Turns out I fucking hate it.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>That’s useful information.</p>
          <p>A Care Plan should grow alongside the person it belongs to.</p>
        </RoomSection>

        <RoomSection title="Stop Expecting Yourself to Explain Everything in the Moment">
          <p>
            Figure out what helps while you have access to the part of your brain that can think
            about it.
          </p>
          <p>Write it down.</p>
          <p>Give your loved ones a map.</p>
          <p>Give Future You a checklist.</p>
          <p>Give healthcare providers the information they need.</p>
          <p>Give your community better tools for supporting one another.</p>
          <p>
            And give yourself permission to need different kinds of care on different kinds of
            days.

        <RoomSection title="Important Note">
          <p>
            These Care Plan resources, workshops, and coaching are educational and peer-support
            tools. They are not medical treatment, psychotherapy, case management, crisis
            intervention, or a substitute for individualized professional care.
          </p>
          <p>
            The medical-support portions of the template are intended to help people document
            their existing diagnoses, clinician-provided instructions, known accommodations, and
            established flare plans. General examples in the template should be customized to the
            individual rather than treated as medical instructions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, a Safety / Red Alert Plan can help people think through emergencies in
            advance, but a written plan cannot anticipate every crisis. Immediate medical
            emergencies, imminent danger, or situations where someone cannot remain safe may
            require appropriate professional or emergency support.
          </p>
          <p>
            People creating plans for others should work collaboratively, preserve the person’s
            privacy and autonomy, avoid diagnosing or prescribing treatment outside their
            professional scope, and avoid turning a care plan into a tool for surveillance or
            control.
          </p>
          <p>The person is always more important than the plan.</p>
